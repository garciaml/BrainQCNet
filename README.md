MRIQCNet is a software that automatically detects the presence of defaults on brain structural MRI scans. 

It is based on a Deep Learning algorithm, you can find more details on how it was built on the paper [here](https://link-to-preprint.com).

To run MRIQCNet on your data, you can either use the BIDS-app that works on **Nvidia GPU machines with CUDA [here](https://github.com/garciaml/MRIQCNet/blob/master/MRIQCNet_GPU/)**, or the one that works on **CPU machines [here](https://github.com/garciaml/MRIQCNet/tree/master/MRIQCNet_CPU)**.

A list of Nvidia GPUs with CUDA technology is provided [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).
