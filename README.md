MRIQCNet is a software that automatically detects the presence of defaults on brain structural MRI scans. 

It is based on a Deep Learning algorithm, you can find more details on how it was built on the paper [here](https://link-to-preprint.com).

To run MRIQCNet on your data, you can use the BIDS-app that works on Nvidia GPU machines [here](https://link-to-doc-GPU.com) and that works on CPU [here](https://link-to-doc-CPU.com).
